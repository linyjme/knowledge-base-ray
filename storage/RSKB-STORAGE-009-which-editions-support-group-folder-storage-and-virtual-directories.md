# Which editions support group-folder storage and virtual directories?

## Short answer

Group-folder storage space with multiple virtual directories is documented as SMB: Supported; Enterprise: Supported; Cloud: Not supported; Multiple Spaces: Supported. A blank cell remains unspecified and must not be read as unsupported.

## Scope and evidence

This article interprets the supplied feature-matrix entry for administrators. A source milestone records an appearance or change and does not establish the minimum supported version of the complete capability.

A blank edition cell is **unspecified**. It must not be interpreted as unsupported or as proof of support. Any source version note is a feature appearance or change milestone, not the minimum version of this complete article.

Keep the scope explicit: a user account, group, role, space, policy, and storage allocation are distinct objects. A change or entitlement in one scope must not be assumed for another.

## Interpretation and recovery boundary

If the deployed edition or behavior differs, stop and verify the exact product version and edition with Raysync support.

This article does not authorize a state change. If the exact version, edition, target, or observed behavior differs from the supplied evidence, do not infer a broader capability or alter production state to make the description fit.

## Verification

The administrator verifies the edition cell and applies only the explicitly documented availability statement.

## Escalation

Escalate with the product version, edition, component, and observed result; do not include credentials or private data.
